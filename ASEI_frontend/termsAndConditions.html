      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Last updated: <time datetime="2025-10-07">7 Oct 2025</time></p>

      <h2>About these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms and Conditions govern your use of the ASEI platform (“Platform”). They become binding when you gain access to the Platform and remain in effect while your access is active. Proceeding to use the Platform constitutes your agreement to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Features and Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform enables integration of third-party APIs into enterprise systems via drag-and-drop workflows to improve operational efficiency.
      </p>

      <h2>Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Using the Platform may enable us and connected third-party applications to view, access, and monitor certain information (e.g., banking or integration data) that you choose to connect. You are responsible for the information you share with third parties. ASEI/Connectify is not responsible for transactions or activity occurring outside the Platform. We may update these Terms at any time and will provide notice of material changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Costs and Fees</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently no fees for using the Platform. If you are asked to make a payment that appears inconsistent with these Terms or official notices, stop and report it immediately.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Beware of scams or impersonation attempts.</li>
        <li>Do not share your password or authentication methods with anyone (including family, friends, or third-party websites).</li>
        <li>Notify us immediately if you suspect your account or credentials have been compromised. Delay may affect liability for unauthorised transactions.</li>
        <li>Report mistaken payments as soon as possible so we can assist where feasible.</li>
        <li>
          You consent to sharing necessary personal and transactional information with specific third parties to deliver the services (see <em>Third-Party Access</em>). Report any suspicious requests outside this list.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform uses secure domains and HTTPS/TLS to protect data in transit. You are responsible for protecting your account (choose a strong password, keep details up to date, and do not share credentials). Failure to do so may lead to suspension to protect your account and the Platform.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform connects to external providers to deliver integrations. These may include (non-exhaustive):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google APIs</li>
        <li>MTN</li>
        <li>Flutterwave</li>
        <li>Airtel</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Availability of integrations depends on each provider’s systems, terms, and uptime.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Closure</h2>
      <p>
        When you close your account, associated personal details are removed from our active databases subject to legal and operational retention requirements. We may suspend or close accounts without prior notice if fraudulent, abusive, or malicious activity is suspected.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform does not provide financial advice, manage funds, or guarantee transaction outcomes. It provides integration tooling only. Results depend on third-party APIs and their availability. Any limitations, outages, or errors on third-party systems are outside Connectify’s control and responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Platform only for lawful purposes.</li>
        <li>Provide accurate information and keep it current.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to breach, probe, or interfere with Platform security or functionality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Monitoring and Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        If you detect suspicious or unauthorised activity, notify us immediately. System logs and notifications may be provided to help you monitor activity related to your account.
      </p>

      <h2>Protecting Your Details</h2>
      <p>
        You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and authentication tools. We will not request sensitive authentication codes without context and consent. Do not provide information to untrusted sources.
      </p>

      <h2>Reporting Issues</h2>
      <p>
        If you encounter any issues while using the Platform, report them promptly through the designated support channel.
      </p>

      <h2>Acceptance</h2>
      <p>
        By using the Platform, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms and Conditions.
