      <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Last updated: <time datetime="2025-10-07">7 Oct 2025</time></p>

      <h2>About the Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <p>
        This page sets out the terms and conditions regarding the usage of this platform. These Terms and Conditions become binding once you gain access to the platform, and will be active as long as your access method is active. Processing to agree will consent you to these Terms and Conditions.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Features and Benefits</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this platform is to integrate third-party APIs into enterprise systems through drag-and-drop functionalities to make it more efficient.
      </p>

      <h2>Risks</h2>
      <p>
        Using this platform enables us and other third-party applications to view, access, and monitor your banking information. It is important to understand that you are responsible for the information you give other parties, and Connectify is not responsible for any missing transactions outside of the platform. We have the right to change these Terms and Conditions at any time, and will notify you of any changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Costs and Fees</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently no costs to using the platform. If you are asked to make a payment higher than the fee you entered, exit it immediately and report it.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Management</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be aware of any scams or imposters that may try to use your account.</li>
        <li>Do not share your password or authentication service to anyone including family members, friends, authorised users, or third-party websites.</li>
        <li>Notify us immediately if you suspect your account or credentials have been compromised. Delay may affect liability for unauthorised transactions.</li>
        <li>Regarding mistaken payments, inform us as soon as possible to be able to help mitigate the issue.</li>
        <li>
          You consent to sharing necessary personal and transactional information with specific third parties to deliver the services (see <em>Third-Party Access</em>). Report any suspicious requests outside this list.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        Connectify uses a secure local domain to ensure that your data is kept protected. It is your responsibility to protect your own account, including using a strong password, keeping your details updated, and not sharing information with anyone else. Failure to do so may result in the suspension of your account.
      </p>

      <h2>Third-Party Access</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform connects to external providers to deliver integrations. These may include (non-exhaustive):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Google APIs</li>
        <li>MTN</li>
        <li>Flutterwave</li>
        <li>Airtel</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Availability of integrations depends on each provider’s systems, terms, and uptime.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Closure</h2>
      <p>
        When you close your account, associated personal details are removed from our active databases subject to legal and operational retention requirements. We may suspend or close accounts without prior notice if fraudulent, abusive, or malicious activity is suspected.
      </p>

      <h2>Product Disclosure</h2>
      <p>
        This platform does not offer any financial advice, manage funds, or guarantee transaction outcomes. It is for integration services only. Integrations are dependent on third-party APIs and the availability of services may vary based on the providers. Any limitations, outages, or errors from third-parties are outside Connectivity’s responsibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the Platform only for lawful purposes.</li>
        <li>Provide accurate information and keep it current.</li>
        <li>Do not attempt to breach, probe, or interfere with Platform security or functionality.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Monitoring and Notifications</h2>
      <p>
        If you detect suspicious or unauthorised activity, notify us immediately. System logs and notifications may be provided to help you monitor activity related to your account.
      </p>

      <h2>Protecting Your Details</h2>
      <p>
        The user is responsible for keeping their personal information secure, such as their login credentials and authentication tools. Connectify will not request authentication without your consent. Do not provide information to unreliable sources.
      </p>

      <h2>Reporting Issues</h2>
